# VLANs, Routing, and Fault Tolerance

This repository demonstrates how VLAN segmentation and routing decisions impact scalability, security, and fault tolerance in large education networks.

## Network Segmentation

**Technical View**  
VLANs reduce broadcast domains, limit lateral movement, and enable policy enforcement.

**Non-Technical View**  
Different groups share the same network without interfering with each other.

## Routing and Scalability

Routing enables controlled communication between VLANs and allows networks to grow without redesign.

**Non-Technical Explanation:**  
Routing determines how information moves between different parts of the network. As a school district grows, routing ensures new buildings, classrooms, and systems can be added without slowing down or disrupting existing services.

## Fault Tolerance

Redundant gateways and uplinks eliminate single points of failure and ensure instructional continuity.


**Non-Technical Explanation:**  
Fault tolerance means the network has built-in backups. If one connection or device fails, another path automatically takes over, allowing instruction and operations to continue without interruption.
