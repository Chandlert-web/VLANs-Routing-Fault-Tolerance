Problem Description

After a new school wing was added to an existing campus, staff began reporting slow network performance, intermittent application timeouts, and occasional loss of connectivity during peak instructional hours.

Initial Assessment (Design-Level Issue)

This issue did not present as a single device failure. Symptoms were widespread and coincided with increased device count, indicating a scalability and segmentation problem, not a hardware outage.

Step 1: Validate VLAN Segmentation
Command
show vlan brief

Expected Output
VLAN Name              Status    Ports
---- ----------------- --------- -----------------------------
10   Instructional     active    Gi1/0/1-48
20   Administrative    active
30   Guest             active

Explanation

All instructional and administrative devices are sharing VLAN 10

Large broadcast domain increases congestion

No separation between student and staff traffic

Segmentation is insufficient for current scale

Conclusion:
The network was not segmented appropriately for growth.

Step 2: Evaluate Routing and Gateway Design
Command
show ip route

Expected Output
Gateway of last resort is 172.16.1.1

10.10.10.0/24 is directly connected, Vlan10
0.0.0.0/0 via 172.16.1.1

Explanation

Single instructional subnet handling all traffic

No additional routed VLANs to distribute load

Routing design limits scalability

Any issue in VLAN 10 impacts the entire school

Design Insight:
Routing was functional, but not scalable.

Corrective Action: Improve Segmentation and Routing
Design Changes Implemented

Split instructional traffic into multiple VLANs

Separated student and staff devices

Introduced additional routed interfaces

Planned redundancy at the gateway layer

Step 3: Implement Improved VLAN Segmentation
Configuration (Illustrative)
vlan 10
 name Instructional-Students
vlan 40
 name Instructional-Staff

Verification
show vlan brief

VLAN Name                     Status    Ports
---- ------------------------ --------- ---------------------
10   Instructional-Students   active    Gi1/0/1-32
40   Instructional-Staff      active    Gi1/0/33-48

Explanation

Broadcast domains reduced

Traffic patterns are now predictable

Troubleshooting scope is significantly smaller

Step 4: Validate Routing Between VLANs (Scalability)
Command
show ip route

Expected Output
10.10.10.0/24 is directly connected, Vlan10
10.10.40.0/24 is directly connected, Vlan40
0.0.0.0/0 via 172.16.1.1

Explanation

Each VLAN has a dedicated routed interface

New segments can be added without redesign

Routing now supports growth instead of limiting it

Step 5: Validate Fault Tolerance at the Gateway
Command
show standby brief

Expected Output
Interface   Grp  Pri  State   Active          Standby
Vlan10      1    110  Active  local           10.10.10.2
Vlan40      1    110  Active  local           10.10.40.2

Explanation

Redundant gateway in place

Automatic failover enabled

No single point of failure at Layer 3

Resolution Summary
Technical Summary

The issue was caused by insufficient VLAN segmentation and a routing design that did not scale with increased device count. By segmenting traffic, improving routing structure, and introducing gateway redundancy, performance stabilized and future growth was supported.

Non-Technical Summary

The network grew, but it wasn’t organized to handle the increased demand. Separating traffic and adding backup paths allowed the network to operate smoothly again.

Key Takeaway

VLANs organize traffic, routing enables growth, and fault tolerance ensures continuity. All three must work together for large education networks to scale reliably.
